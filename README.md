# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition

<h3> Introduction</h3>
In this project, we're going to create a recommend neural network and create it on a tweet emotion data set to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The data set has thousands of tweets, each classified in one off six emotions. We will take a closer look at the examples and labels in a few minutes is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain. We will be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework. The project uses the Google Collab environment, which is a fantastic tool for creating and running Jupiter notebooks in the cloud. You will need prior programming experience in Python.This is a practical hands-on guided project for learners who already have theoretical understanding off. Neural networks recommend neural networks and optimization algorithms like creating dissent, but I want to understand how to use TensorFlow to start performing natural language processing tasks like text classification. 

**Alright, so that's enough for the introduction. Letâ€™s continue to the next task and start working on this project.**

<h3> Dataset Summary</h3>

- [Tweet Emotion Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion)

Emotion is a dataset of English Twitter messages with six basic emotions:

| Emotion | label    |                 
| :-------- | :------- | 
| `Sadness` | `0` | 
| `Joy` | `1` | 
| `Love` | `2` |
